Kunafa cups 

### Ingredients

Sugar syrup

1 cup (225g) sugar
½ cup (125ml) water
½ tsp lemon juice
½ tsp vanilla bean paste
Kunafa crust

320g (11oz) of kunafa filo pastry, shredded (try Middle Eastern or Turkish supermarkets)
5 tbsps butter (also extra to grease the muffin tray)
½ tsp orange food colouring (optional - add more if you want)
Filling

¾ cup (180ml) milk
½ cup (115ml) heavy whipping cream
2 tbsp granulated sugar
1½ tbsp semolina
½ tsp cornflour
½ tsp water
110g (4oz) mozzarella, grated

### Recept 

Sugar syrup

1- In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water and lemon juice. Set on a stovetop over a medium high heat. Stir just to combine, then let it be (if the sugar doesn't dissolve,  you can stir a couple more times but as soon as it starts to boil, stop stirring).

2- Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes, at the most. Once its consistency has thickened, remove from the stove immediately.

3- Once off the heat, stir in the vanilla bean paste and set aside to cool.

Semolina pudding

1- In a small saucepan, combine the milk, cream, sugar and semolina.

2- Mix the cornflour and water separately until it dissolves, then add this to the mixture in the saucepan.

3- Place over a medium-high heat and cook, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, and continue cooking for about three more minutes or until the mixture thickens into a custard-like consistency (add more cornflour if needed).  

4- Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the kunafa.

Kunafa crust

1- In a large bowl, shred the kunafa pastry into 1in (2.5 cm) long pieces (kitchen scissors may help).

2- Melt the butter and add it over the shredded pastry.

3- Toss with your hands until all the strands are evenly coated and glisten. This really important – and it will be worth it…

4- Set aside, ready for assembly.

Assembling

1- Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).

2- Using a pastry brush, spread some of the extra butter on to a muffin tray. Make sure to coat the sides of the holes of the muffin tray as well.

3- Put a few drops of the orange food colouring into the bowl of melted butter. Spread this orange butter on to the base, and up the side, of each muffin hole.

4- Add the base layer of kunafa pastry into each muffin hole.  Pack it in tightly using something small like a pestle or measuring cup. Make sure to bring the kunafa up to the sides of the hole too, so that you create a well for your filling.

5- Add the mozzarella to the cooled semolina pudding and stir.

6- Add about 1 tbsp of the cheese-semolina mix to each hole, before covering with more kunafa pastry.

7- Press down lightly so that it is sealed. Be gentle as you don't want the mixture to spill out.

Baking

1- Place in the oven for about 20-30 mins, until the tops look golden brown.

2- Remove from the oven and immediately pour on ¾ of the syrup and decorate with some chopped pistachios.

3- Leave to cool ever so slightly before carefully flipping over the muffin tray. The individual kunafa cups should easily come out.

4- Serve the kunafa cups warm with the extra syrup for those who want to top up their cup
