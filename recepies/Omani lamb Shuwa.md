# method
Method: 
In a frying pan, combine all the spices and dry fry on a medium to high heat, just till it begins to smoke and you can smell a strong aroma.

Ensure you keep stirring the spices. Do not leave on the heat on for too long as the spices can burn easily and you’ll be left with a bitter taste.

Place the mixture in a blender and blitz until you have a fine powder.

Combine the spice mix with the vinegar, limes, salt, garlic and oil.

Mix them together well until you have formed a paste (I use a pestle and mortar)

Place your meat inside a roasting tray that is covered in foil.

Using a knife, cut small slits all over the meat to allow the marinade to get inside.

Pour the marinade over and massage with your hands into all the creases, folds and cuts of the meat.

Don’t worry if you have excess marinade left over. Just pour it all over.

To finish, pull the foil from the bottom and wrap it over the meat so it is sealed like a parcel, make sure there are NO gaps! We don’t want any juice or air to escape in the cooking process.
