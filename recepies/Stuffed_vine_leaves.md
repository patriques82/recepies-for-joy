Lebanese stuffed grape leaves, or "Warak Enab" (ورق عنب), are a beloved dish in Lebanese cuisine. These tender grape leaves are filled with a flavorful mixture of rice, vegetables, and sometimes meat, then slowly cooked in a lemony broth. Here's a classic recipe to make this dish:

Ingredients
For the Filling:
1 cup short-grain rice, rinsed
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely diced
1/2 cup parsley, finely chopped
1/4 cup mint leaves, finely chopped (optional)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tsp ground allspice
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp black pepper
Salt, to taste
1/2 lb ground lamb or beef (optional for a meat version)
For the Leaves:
1 jar grape leaves (about 60 leaves) or fresh grape leaves blanched
3 garlic cloves, peeled
2-3 lemons, juiced
1/4 cup olive oil
Water, to cover
Potato slices (optional, to line the pot)
Instructions
Prepare the Leaves:

If using jarred grape leaves, rinse thoroughly to remove brine. If using fresh leaves, blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes until pliable, then drain.
Make the Filling:

In a bowl, combine rice, onion, tomatoes, parsley, mint (if using), olive oil, and spices. Mix well.
For a meat version, add the ground lamb or beef and mix until fully incorporated.
Stuff and Roll:

Lay one grape leaf, shiny side down, on a flat surface.
Place a small amount of filling (about 1-2 teaspoons) near the stem end.
Fold the sides over the filling and roll tightly, like a small cigar. Repeat with all leaves.
Layer and Cook:

Line the bottom of a large pot with potato slices or a few unrolled grape leaves to prevent sticking.
Arrange the stuffed grape leaves in snug, circular layers.
Place the garlic cloves between the layers for flavor.
Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the leaves. Add enough water to cover them by about an inch.
Place a heatproof plate or a heavy lid on top to keep the rolls from unravelling.
Simmer:

Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low.
Cover the pot and simmer for 1-2 hours, checking occasionally to ensure the leaves remain submerged. Add more water if necessary.
Serve:

Allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with additional lemon wedges or yogurt on the side.
Tips:
For a vegetarian version, omit the meat and increase the amount of rice and herbs.
These can be prepared a day in advance; they taste even better after resting overnight.
Enjoy your homemade Warak Enab—a dish bursting with the flavors of the Mediterranean!
