Ingredients (Makes about 8 chapatis)

1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)
1 tablespoon oil or ghee (optional, for softer chapatis)
Additional flour for rolling


Instructions

1. Make the Dough
In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.
Gradually add water, a little at a time, and mix to form a soft dough.
Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too sticky, sprinkle a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a few drops of water.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.

2. Divide and Roll
Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and shape each into a ball.
Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Try to keep it even, but don’t worry about perfect shapes!

3. Cook the Chapati
Heat a flat griddle or skillet (tawa) over medium-high heat until hot.
Place a rolled-out chapati on the hot skillet.
Cook for about 30 seconds or until bubbles start to appear. Flip it over.
Cook the second side for 30-40 seconds, pressing gently with a spatula or clean cloth to encourage puffing.
Flip it again and cook the first side for another 10-20 seconds, allowing it to puff up. If it doesn’t puff, it’s still delicious!

4. Serve
Stack cooked chapatis in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft.
Serve immediately with your favorite curry, dal, or vegetable dishes.

Tips for Perfect Chapatis
Soft Dough: A well-kneaded, soft dough is the key to soft chapatis.
Even Rolling: Uneven thickness can cause uneven cooking or burning.
High Heat: Cook chapatis on a hot griddle for best results.
Puffing: Gently pressing the edges with a spatula can help chapatis puff up.
